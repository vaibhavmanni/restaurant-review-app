## Description

* This project is a part of Udacity's Front-End Web Developer course. The project is a Restaurant Reviews Webapp that shows location, details and reviews of some restaurants.

## Project Instructions

* In this project, a static webpage is provided as the starter code by Udacity. The webpage lacks accessibilty and in not responsive. The goal of the project is to optimize the starter code to make it accessible for all people, responsive on all devices and usable when offline.


## Run the Application
1. See live Project [here.](https://vaibhavmanni.github.io/restaurant-review-app/)
                
                OR

2. Download as .zip file or clone this project:

* In this folder, start up a simple HTTP server to serve up the site files on your local computer. Python has some simple tools to do this, and you don't even need to know Python. For most people, it's already installed on your computer. 

* In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 8000`. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.

* With your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:8000`.
